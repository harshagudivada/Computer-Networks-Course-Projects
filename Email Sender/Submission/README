README:

This Email client consists of only one EmailSender.java file. First compile it 
as "javac EmailSender.java". Now  run using the command "java EmailSender".

This Email Client is interactive. It asks you the Sender email Id, receiver's
email Id, subject and content in the message. As this is not using any 
authentication, the sent mail may be put in Spam.
