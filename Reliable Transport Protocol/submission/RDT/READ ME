 ALTERNATING BIT AND GO-BACK-N NETWORK EMULATOR: VERSION 1.1  J.F.Kurose

   This code should be used for PA2, unidirectional or bidirectional
   data transfer protocols (from A to B. Bidirectional transfer of data
   is for extra credit and is not required).  Network properties:
   - one way network delay averages five time units (longer if there
     are other messages in the channel for GBN), but can be larger
   - packets can be corrupted (either the header or the data portion)
     or lost, according to user-defined probabilities
   - packets will be delivered in the order in which they were sent
     (although some can be lost).

abp.c:
	The procedures, A_output(),A_input(),A_timerinterrupt(),A_init(),B_input(), 
and B_init() which together will implement a stop-and-wait (i.e., 
the alternating bit protocol, which we referred to as rdt3.0 in the text)
unidirectional transfer of data from the A-side to the B-side.

	Our procedures might print out a message whenever an event occurs at your 
sender or receiver (a message/packet arrival, or a timer interrupt) as well as
any action taken in response. 

gbn.c:
	The procedures, A_output(),A_input(),A_timerinterrupt(),A_init(),B_input(), 
and B_init() which together will implement a Go-Back-N unidirectional transfer 
of data from the A-side to the B-side, with a window size of 8.
