WebProxy class is used to create a Server socket listening for connections from 
clients. Depending on the no.of command line arguemnts, this proxy class handles
2 cases.
1.It can directly parse,understand and forward to the web server if this proxy
has access to internet.
2. Else, if it did not have internet and under another proxy which has access
to internet, it just relays the data between the clients and the proxy with 
internet access.
The main thread creates worker threads for each connection request. Hence it 
is a "Multi threaded Web Proxy Server"
